# econ_growth
This project contains the Python code related to the economic growth model similar to the one considered in the paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0278641917020042
but on infinite horizon.

The code allows to examine the n-dimensional economic model with the Cobb-Douglas production function on infinite horizon. The utility function has the integral form with discounting; the integrant is of the logarithm type. The model assumes that all depreciation rates are equal. Application of the Pontryagin maximum principle leads to a boundary-value problem with a special transversality condition. The presence of special regimes in the optimal solution complicates the boundary value problem of the maximum principle. Under certain assumptions on the right-hand sides of the differential equations, the studied problem allows a biological interpretation in the model of optimal growth of crops with an arbitrary number of vegetative organs.



Keywords: multifactor economic model, Cobb-Douglas function, optimal control, maximum principle.
